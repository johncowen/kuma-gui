# x

Our application level UI components.

These 'x' components are generally 'thin wrappers' over either native Vue
components or [Kongponents](https://kongponents.konghq.com/) to make them
easier to work with.


For example:

- `XAction`: Use these for `<a>`s or `<button>`s. They wrap Vue's `RouterLink`.
- `XTeleportTemplate`/`XTeleportSlot`: Use these for rendering things in a
  different place to where you are writing it. They wrap Vue's `Teleport`.
- `XTabs`: Basic tab navigation. They wrap `KTabs`.
